=head1 NAME

pacaur - a fast workflow AUR helper using cower as backend

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage: I<pacaur> E<lt>operationE<gt> [ options ] [ target(s) ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pacaur is an Arch User Repository (AUR) helper aiming at speed and simplicity
and is designed to minimize user prompt interaction. It uses an uncluttered
interface and makes use of the full secured RPC interface to solve the dependency
tree. It is built upon the well designed cower and expac C backends.

Invoking pacaur consists of supplying an operation, any applicable options, and
usually one or more targets. A I<target> is usually a package name or a search
string.

=head1 USERBASE TARGET

Pacaur is targeted at B<advanced users> who want some degree of automation for
repetitive tasks. As such, the user is expected to be familiar with the AUR
manual build process with makepkg and its configuration options, as well as
being knowledgeable about sudo and gpg configuration.

Two sets of command line options are provided: commands which call the pacman
binary and extend it with AUR functions B<(-S, -Ss, -Si, -Sw, -Su, -Qu, -Sc, -Scc)>,
and commands which are AUR specific B<(-s, -i, -d, -m, -y, -k, -u)>. As such,
pacaur can be used by users who prefer to have a single tool to manage the
official and AUR repositories, or by users who prefer to keep their AUR
frontend separated from pacman.

=head1 OPERATIONS

=head2 Pacman extension operations

=over 4

=item B<-S, -Ss, -Si, -Sw, -Su, -Qu, -Sc, -Scc>

Pacaur wraps B<pacman operations> and extends respectively its install, search,
info, download only, update, check updates and clean functions for the AUR. This
behavior is optional and can be disabled with the I<fallback> variable in the
config file. Pacaur will also pass any pacman related options to the pacman
binary.

=back

=head2 AUR specific operations

=over 4

=item B<-s, --search>

Search for packages with the I<target(s)> as the search term(s). Queries with
multiple targets will return the result of the intersection of all query
results. Extended regex patterns as defined by POSIX are allowed.

=item B<-i, --info>

Show info for I<target(s)>.

=item B<-d, --download>

Download I<target(s)> PKGBUILD. Pass this option twice to fetch dependencies
(done recursively).

=item B<-m, --makepkg>

Download PKGBUILD and build I<target(s)>. Missing dependencies will be installed
as required to ensure the build to succeed, before being automatically
uninstalled.

=item B<-y, --sync>

Download PKGBUILD, build and install I<target(s)>. Missing dependencies will be
automatically installed as required.

=item B<-k, --check>

Check foreign packages for updates in the AUR. Without any arguments, all
manually installed packages will be checked. If I<target(s)> are supplied, only
those packages will be checked.

=item B<-u, --update>

Update foreign packages in the AUR. Without any arguments, all manually
installed packages will be updated. If I<target(s)> are supplied, only those
packages will be updated.

=back

=head2 General operations

=over 4

=item B<-v, --version>

Display version and quit.

=item B<-h, --help>

Display the help message and quit.

=back


=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 Pacman extension options

=over 4

=item B<-a, --aur>

When used with pacman extended operations, only search, download, build, install
or update I<target(s)> from the AUR.

=item B<-r, --repo>

When used with pacman extended operations, only search, download, build, install
or update I<target(s)> from the repositories.

=back

=head2 AUR specific options

=over 4

=item B<-c, --clean>

Remove build files after building I<target(s)>. Pass this option twice to force
cleaning when the I<cleandevel> option is disabled. Can also be used as a
standalone command. When passed twice without any arguments, clean the entire
build directory.

=item B<-f, --force>

Overwrite existing files when downloading I<target(s)> PKGBUILD.

=back

=head2 General options

=over 4

=item B<-e, --edit>

Edit PKGBUILD and view install script when downloading or building I<target(s)>.
Can also be used as a standalone command.

=item B<-q, --quiet>

Show less information for search and query operations. Search will only show
package names and not version, group, and description information.

=item B<--devel>

When used with update and check operations, also consider AUR development packages
(supported are I<cvs>, I<svn>, I<git>, I<hg>, I<bzr> and I<darcs> development
packages, as well as I<nightly> build packages).

=item B<--foreign>

When used with build, install and update operations, also consider already
installed foreign dependencies.

=item B<--ignore> I<target(s)>

Ignore a I<target> upgrade. Can be used more than once. Also accepts a comma
delimited list as a single argument. Packages listed in pacman and cower's
I<IgnorePkg> directive are honored.

=item B<--needed>

Do not reinstall I<target(s)> that are already up-to-date. The build of
development packages (supported are I<svn>, I<git>, I<hg> and I<bzr> development
packages) that are found up-to-date after the source checkout will be skipped.

=item B<--noconfirm>

Perform commands without confirmation from the user.

=item B<--noedit>

Perform commands without editing any installation files. Overrides the
I<--edit> option.

=item B<--rebuild>

Always rebuild packages regardless of any existing file in I<$PKGDEST> directory,
and regardless of up-to-date status of development packages.

=item B<--silent>

Silence output. This will send the output of each packaging functions to text
files in the build directory named I<pkgname-pkgver-pkgrel-arch-function.log>.
Additional pacman output for providers and cached packages installation will
also be hidden.

=item B<--ignore-ood>

When searching the AUR, ignore all results marked as out of date.

=item B<--no-ignore-ood>

When searching the AUR, also show results marked as out of date. This takes
precedence over the I<IgnoreOOD> option in the cower config file.

=item B<--asort>

When searching the AUR, sort the results by name in alphabetical order.

=item B<--vsort>

When searching the AUR, sort the results by decreasing number of votes.

=item B<--psort>

When searching the AUR, sort the results by decreasing popularity.

=item B<--domain> <FQDN>

Point at a domain other than the default I<aur.archlinux.org>.

=back


=head1 CONFIG FILE

=over 4

=item B<system config>

Pacaur honors a system-wide config file which will be looked for first at

  $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/pacaur/config

and falling back to

  /etc/xdg/pacaur/config

=item B<user config>

User-defined configuration files overriding the general settings will be looked
for first at

  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pacaur/config

and falling back to

  $HOME/.config/pacaur/config

=item B<other config>

In addition, pacaur fully honors cower's config file. See B<cower>(1).

=back

=head1 CONFIG OPTIONS

The available options are:

=over 4

=item B<builddir>

Define the build directory. Default is I<$BUILDDIR>, with a fallback on
B</tmp/pacaurtmp-$USER>.

=item B<editor>

Define the editor. Default is I<$EDITOR>, with a fallback on B<vi>.

=item B<editpkgbuild>

Enable PKGBUILD and install script editing prompt. Default is B<true>.

=item B<fallback>

Extend pacman commands to the AUR. Default is B<true>.

=item B<clean>

Clean build directory after operation. Default is B<true>.

=item B<cleandevel>

When the B<clean> config option is enabled, this also cleans build directories
of development packages. Default is B<true>.

=item B<silent>

Enable silent output. The makepkg output will be collected in the build
directory of packages should any error occurs. Default is B<false>.

=item B<sortby>

When searching the AUR, sort the results by I<name>, number of I<votes> or
I<popularity>. Default is B<popularity>.

=item B<sudoloop>

Prevent sudo timeout. This option overrides the system-wide sudo configuration
and refreshes the sudo timestamp automatically in a loop when building
packages. Default is B<false>.

=back

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item B<sudo configuration>

To be used with minimal password prompting, I<sudo> should be configured
accordingly to allow sudo access. See B<sudoers>(5). You might also want to
disable the I<passwd_timeout> sudo parameter to avoid password prompt timeout.
Alternatively, enable the I<sudoloop> config option.

=item B<pacman misc options>

Miscellaneous options enabled in I<pacman.conf> are taken into account. Thus,
colored output can be enabled with the I<Color> option, while a detailed interface
displaying name, version and size of packages formatted as a table is available
through the I<VerbosePkgLists> option.

=item B<environment variables>

Makepkg environment variables (I<$PACMAN>, I<$PKGDEST>, I<$SRCDEST>, I<LOGDEST>,
I<$BUILDDIR>) are fully honored. See B<makepkg>(8).

=item B<fallback>

By default, any operation will be applied on the binary repositories, then the
AUR if necessary. This behavior is optional and can be disabled with the
I<fallback> config option. When disabled, any operation will be restricted to the
binary repositories similarly to pacman, while AUR operations can be applied
explicitly with the I<--aur> option.

=item B<build directory>

You might want to change the default build directory (set to /tmp on a temporary
filesystem residing in volatile memory) especially when building big packages on
a low-memory machine.

=item B<build cleaning>

If you want to avoid cleaning up the build directory of packages, disable the
I<clean> config option. If you want to avoid cleaning up the build directory of
development packages, disable the I<cleandevel> config option. This will speed
up the update even if the I<clean> config option is enabled for normal packages.
You might also want to change the default build directory which is
automatically cleared upon reboot. Alternatively, you can enable source caching
with the makepkg I<$SRCDEST> environment variable.

=item B<interactive PKGBUILDs>

Packages requiring user input while building are not supported and might fail
to install properly. There is currently no official directive about these
interactive PKGBUILDs, but some of the official pacman developers expressed
the opinion that PKGBUILDs should always provide default compilation options.

=item B<host name error>

If a lot of "Couldn't resolve host name" and "Timeout was reached" messages are
displayed while checking for updates although the internet connection is
working correctly, ensure your local I<DNS server> is correctly configured to
improve name lookups. Using Google's primary DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) might
also help.

=item B<alternative installation root>

The alternative installation root I<--root /path> option of pacman is not
supported. You might want to chroot to the new path and use pacaur from there
instead.
